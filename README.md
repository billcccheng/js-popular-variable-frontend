## Installation
First clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/billcccheng/js-popular-variable-frontend.git
```

Then `npm install` to install all the required packages. After you have
all the packages installed, you can `npm run start` to play around with you app on `port 8000`.

```
npm install
npm run start
```
If you want to change your port to 8080, just go to `package.json` and change `"start":...` to

```
"start": "PORT=8000 react-scripts start"
```

## The Backend Server
* All the logic and searching of the app is loaded on a heroku server. All the source code of the heroku server can be
found [here](https://github.com/billcccheng/js-popular-variable-server)
* Remember to comment out this [line](https://github.com/billcccheng/js-popular-variable-frontend/blob/master/src/actions/fetchDataAction.js#L5) if you want to test the server on your localhost or comment out this [line](https://github.com/billcccheng/js-popular-variable-frontend/blob/master/src/actions/fetchDataAction.js#L4) if you want to use the heroku server.
